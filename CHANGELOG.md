# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Notice

obsidian-llm-wiki is entering maintenance mode. Bug fixes will continue to be
released here. New features and capabilities are being built in
[Synto](https://github.com/kytmanov/synto), the successor project. See the
README for migration details.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Malformed LaTeX in LLM output** — `\[ ... \]` display-math delimiters and
  bare LaTeX lines (e.g. `\frac{a}{b}`) are now automatically converted to
  Obsidian-compatible `$$ ... $$` notation in both the compile and query
  pipelines. Existing code blocks and math regions are protected from
  rewriting. Closes [#67](https://github.com/kytmanov/obsidian-llm-wiki-local/issues/67).

## [0.8.4] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **API key prompt for local providers in setup wizard** — vLLM, LM Studio,
  and other non-Ollama local providers can be deployed with key verification
  in enterprise environments. The setup wizard now shows the optional API key
  prompt for all non-Ollama providers, not only cloud or custom ones. Closes
  [#64](https://github.com/kytmanov/obsidian-llm-wiki-local/issues/64).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **Release metadata alignment** — the published package version, runtime
  `__version__`, and changelog are now aligned again after `v0.8.2` was tagged
  from code that still declared `0.8.1`, which prevented a new PyPI release
  from being uploaded.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added internal foundation types and reader/engine interfaces for future
  source-aware and pack-oriented features. These are additive and are not
  wired into runtime behavior yet.

### Fixed

- **Saved query/link hygiene** — query and synthesis outputs now strip invented
  `[[wikilinks]]` that do not resolve to existing pages, preventing broken links
  from being written into `wiki/queries/` and `wiki/synthesis/`.
- **Compile overflow diagnostics** — prompt-context retry failures now preserve
  the `context_too_large` failure category instead of degrading to `other` when
  reduced retry budgets still cannot fit within the configured context window.
- **LM Studio smoke/runtime robustness** — smoke model resolution and compile
  fallback handling were hardened so prompt/context overflow scenarios are more
  recoverable and easier to diagnose.

### Changed

- **Schema migration v7 -> v8** (additive). `raw_notes` gains six new
  columns: `source_type` (default `'notes'`), `origin_uri`, `imported_at`,
  `normalized_hash`, `extractor_version`, `prompt_version`. Existing rows
  get the default for `source_type` and `NULL` elsewhere. No code path
  reads the new columns yet. v0.8 behavior is unchanged.

### Migration notes

- On first run with this version, `state.db` upgrades from v7 to v8
  automatically. Recommended: back up `.olw/state.db` first
  (`cp .olw/state.db .olw/state.db.bak.v7`). The upgrade is one-way:
  downgrading the package after upgrading the DB leaves a `version=8`
  row. Older code paths still function but are not regression-tested
  against future schemas.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-02

### Highlights

**v0.8.0 adds query synthesis as a first-class workflow.** You can now save grounded answers as durable synthesis articles in `wiki/synthesis/`, deduplicate them by normalized question hash, and keep compare runs isolated from active query and synthesis content.

### New Features

- **`olw query --synthesize`** — answer a question from the wiki and save the result as a published synthesis article in `wiki/synthesis/`.
- **Question-hash deduplication** — repeated synthesis requests for the same normalized question reuse the existing article instead of creating duplicates.
- **Saved query outputs** — query answers can be persisted in `wiki/queries/` alongside synthesis articles for later review.

### Changes

- **Safer synthesis bookkeeping** — synthesis articles are tracked in state with `kind`, `question_hash`, and source hashes so duplicate detection and update-in-place behavior stay deterministic.
- **Query/link hygiene** — query resolution now understands `sources/...` links and lint flags synthesis-to-synthesis source chains as advisory issues instead of silently allowing them.
- **Compare safety coverage** — compare runs explicitly avoid mutating active `wiki/queries/` and `wiki/synthesis/`, with smoke coverage for those guarantees.
- **Docs refresh** — README and smoke guidance now cover query synthesis, LM Studio flows, and the latest support links.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-01

### Highlights

**Fixes silent compile failures on local LLM providers (#48).** Articles whose generated output exceeded `article_max_tokens` previously surfaced as confusing JSON-parse errors with empty model responses on llama.cpp/LM Studio. Truncation is now detected at the HTTP layer and surfaced as `LLMTruncatedError` with an actionable message naming the exact config knob to raise.

### Bug Fixes

- **Legacy compile path respects `article_max_tokens` (#48)** — `compile_notes` (the `--legacy` path) was hardcoded to 4096 tokens and ignored `pipeline.article_max_tokens`. It now uses the same `_article_num_predict` budget as the primary `compile_concepts` path.
- **Truncation detection in HTTP clients** — both `OpenAICompatClient` and `OllamaClient` now inspect `finish_reason`/`done_reason` and raise `LLMTruncatedError` instead of returning empty content, eliminating the silent JSON-parse failure mode.
- **Cloud max_tokens auto-downgrade** — providers that reject `max_tokens` as exceeding the model's hard output limit (e.g. legacy gpt-4-turbo with 4096-output models) now trigger a single halve-and-retry instead of bubbling an HTTP 400 to the user.
- **Pre-flight context-budget guard** — `_article_num_predict` raises `ValueError` (caught per-concept) when source content fills `heavy_ctx` past the floor needed for reliable JSON generation, instead of silently sending `num_predict=0`.

### Changes

- **`pipeline.article_max_tokens` default raised to 16384** (was 4096). Restores the original `heavy_ctx // 2` design that was lowered defensively to dodge an LM Studio HTTP 400 already covered by an existing auto-downgrade.
- **`PipelineConfig.article_max_tokens` validator** rejects values below 512 (the floor required for structured generation).
- **`olw lint`** surfaces a `config_outdated` issue when `article_max_tokens == 4096`, guiding existing users whose `wiki.toml` still pins the legacy default.
- **Compile failure summary** logs a per-category count (`truncated`, `bad_request`, `structured_output`, `context_too_large`) at the end of each compile run, distinguishing truncation issues from JSON-schema or no-source failures.
- **`n_keep > n_ctx` auto-downgrade** now logs at WARNING (was DEBUG), surfacing the silent context-mismatch fallback to the user.

### Migration

If your `wiki.toml` was generated by an earlier `olw setup` it likely contains `article_max_tokens = 4096`. Either delete the line to pick up the new default or raise it explicitly:

```toml
[pipeline]
article_max_tokens = 16384
```

`olw lint` will flag this until corrected.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-28

### Highlights

**v0.7.1 hardens long-note recovery and concept compile retries.** Interrupted chunked ingest can now resume from saved progress, and failed concept articles remain retryable instead of disappearing behind source-level completion state.

### Bug Fixes

- **Resumable chunked ingest (#44)** — long notes persist successful chunk analyses as checkpoints and reruns skip completed chunks instead of starting over after an intermittent LLM failure.
- **Failed concept compile recovery (#42)** — compile scheduling now tracks status per concept/source pair, so partial success no longer marks an entire raw note done while some concepts are still failed.
- **Changed compiled notes re-ingest correctly** — `olw ingest` now skips previously ingested/compiled notes only when the stored content hash still matches the file on disk.
- **Checkpoint cleanup for shortened notes** — stale chunk checkpoints are purged when a note no longer needs chunking.
- **Safer compile token budget** — article generation now clamps `num_predict` to the true remaining context budget instead of forcing a minimum that can exceed provider limits.
- **Published article link hygiene** — generated output cleanup removes malformed empty wikilinks before publication.

### Changes

- **Targeted concept compile** — `olw compile --concept NAME` can compile a specific concept even when it is not currently pending.
- **Failed concept retry CLI** — `olw compile --retry-failed` now retries failed concept compiles in addition to failed raw-note ingest records.
- **Article output budget config** — `pipeline.article_max_tokens` can tune the soft article-generation output cap while still respecting provider context limits.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-26

### Highlights

**v0.7.0 improves draft hygiene, graph behavior, and language-agnostic knowledge preservation.** Source citations can stay graph-quiet, generated drafts are less likely to leak malformed media/link syntax, and ambiguous named references are preserved only when explicitly evidenced in the source note rather than inferred from Latin-script regexes.

### New Features

- **Knowledge item audit** — `olw items audit` and `olw items show NAME` expose ambiguous named references and prominent quoted titles without compiling them into concept articles by default.
- **Evidence-gated named references** — ingest now asks the fast model for exact named references copied from the note and stores them only when the text appears in the title, filename, or body. These references use the generic `named_reference` subtype instead of language-specific person/product/org regex classification.
- **Graph-quiet citation controls** — inline source citations can use local `[S1](#Sources)` markers while the canonical source page links remain in the `## Sources` legend.

### Changes

- **More conservative concept handling** — concept extraction no longer uses test-vault-specific weak-concept denylists or LLM aliases as automatic merge authority.
- **Better generated draft cleanup** — compile post-processing repairs malformed media references, removes dangling markdown-link fragments, and trims quote/citation debris from wikilinks before lint runs.
- **Improved lint coverage** — lint ignores wikilinks inside inline code, catches dangling markdown brackets, and reports draft/published graph filters more clearly.
- **README refresh** — documentation now describes the language-agnostic evidence rules, item audit workflow, source citation styles, draft media behavior, and current LM Studio smoke-test guidance.

### Bug Fixes

- **Structured output resilience** — `AnalysisResult` tolerates `summary: null` from small local models and synthesizes a fallback summary instead of failing ingest.
- **Language-agnostic item extraction** — removed Latin-script-only person, product, and CamelCase organization regexes from the knowledge-item path.
- **Draft media hygiene** — malformed escaped media references such as `!\[...jpeg\]` are normalized before drafts are reviewed or published.

### Known Limitations

- Concept extraction may still overproduce drafts for ambiguous or single-source notes. v0.7.1 is expected to focus on semantic concept filtering, concept-name cleanup, and better item-audit ranking.
- Source-supported named references are intentionally preserved as low-confidence candidates and may include noisy one-off handles or names. Review `olw items audit` before promoting them.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-21

### Highlights

**v0.6.0 adds `olw compare`, a safe way to preview a model or provider switch before changing your vault config.** Instead of benchmarking abstract prompt quality, `olw compare` rebuilds isolated previews from your current vault's `raw/` notes, compares the current setup against one challenger, and tells you whether to switch, keep the current config, or inspect the results manually.

### New Features

- **`olw compare`** — compare the active vault config against a single challenger model/provider configuration using the same source notes. The command produces a recommendation-first report and shows the exact `wiki.toml` config needed to reproduce the challenger setup.

### Changes

- **Safer preview runs** — compare never mutates the active vault outside `.olw/compare/`, rejects unsafe path/symlink inputs, and requires explicit acknowledgement before sending vault content to a cloud provider.
- **Better compare guidance** — reports now include clearer verdicts, config-change instructions, and artifact output designed for manual review instead of benchmark-style winner framing.
- **Docs and smoke coverage** — README and smoke tests now cover the new compare workflow, including LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible local backends.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-19

### Highlights

**v0.5.1 hardens the pipeline against a common quirk of small local models.** When the fast model returns `concepts` as a flat list of strings instead of `{name, aliases}` objects, ingest no longer fails — the payload is coerced transparently and the note proceeds. The root cause, an over-literal JSON template passed to the model, is also fixed so every `list[Model]` field benefits from the same resilience.

### Bug Fixes

- **String-concept tolerance (#32)** — `AnalysisResult` accepts a flat list of concept strings from the LLM and wraps them into `Concept` objects with empty aliases. Mixed payloads (some strings, some dicts) also validate. A `log.debug` line fires when coercion triggers, so the signal stays observable for prompt-tuning.
- **Structured-output template renders nested objects** — the fill-in JSON example passed to the fast model now expands `list[Concept]`, `list[ArticlePlan]`, and `list[LintIssue]` into their real shape, including enum discriminator values. Previously the model saw only the array's description string and sometimes produced wrong item types. `Optional[...]` fields still carry their outer description through `anyOf`.

### Changes

- **Cleaner error when the vault path is missing** — `olw <cmd>` now prints a short, actionable message pointing at `olw init` or `olw setup` instead of surfacing a raw config-loading traceback.
- **Smoke test**: new pre-LLM "Structured output resilience" block pins the validator + template + `request_structured` end-to-end against a stub client, so the class of failure above is caught in the installed artifact without requiring a running model.
- README: concept-block rejection / `olw unblock` section trimmed and clarified.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Highlights

**v0.5 makes the wiki resilient to the natural way humans refer to concepts.** When you write about "Program Counter" once and later mention "PC", `olw` now recognizes they're the same thing. Aliases are extracted at ingest, stored alongside articles, and used everywhere the pipeline resolves a concept name — so broken links to common abbreviations get repaired automatically, and queries using either form land on the right article.

### New Features

- **Concept aliases** — during ingest, the fast model extracts short aliases for each concept (e.g. "Program Counter (PC)" → alias `PC`). Aliases are stored in the state DB and written into each article's `aliases:` frontmatter, so Obsidian picks them up for its own link suggestions.

- **Alias-aware link repair** — `olw maintain --fix` now rewrites broken `[[Alias]]` wikilinks to `[[Canonical|Alias]]` when an unambiguous alias is known. Links inside code fences are left untouched. Still-unresolvable targets fall through to stub creation as before.

- **Alias-aware queries and health checks** — `olw query` resolves page routes through the alias map when the canonical name misses, and `olw lint` counts alias forms as valid links so they don't get flagged as broken.

- **`olw status --failed`** — filter the status report to only failed notes with their error messages. Useful when triaging after a bulk ingest.

### Changes

- The auto-generated wiki index is now `wiki/index.md` (lowercase). Vaults created before v0.5 with `wiki/INDEX.md` are handled transparently — no manual rename needed.
- Smoke test suite expanded: 105 end-to-end assertions now cover lint issue-type coverage, `maintain --fix` idempotency, stub frontmatter shape, legacy-compile bit-rot, and the `status --failed` filter.

### Breaking Changes

None. Existing vaults upgrade automatically on first `olw` run: the DB gains a `concept_aliases` table, aliases are backfilled from current concept titles (deterministic, no LLM calls), and any legacy `INDEX.md` is treated like the new lowercase form.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Highlights

**v0.4 makes `olw` smarter about where you are and what you're writing.** Notes are now analyzed in the language they were written in, and articles are compiled in the same language — no more English-only output in a multilingual vault. You can also reject an entire batch of drafts in one go. Two usability papercuts are fixed: the tool now finds your vault automatically when you're already inside it, and the review menu works correctly in all terminals.

### New Features

- **Multi-language support** — `olw ingest` detects the language of each note and stores it. `olw compile` then writes each article in the appropriate language: the detected language if all sources agree, or the vault-wide `language` setting from `wiki.toml` if configured. French notes produce French articles, Japanese notes produce Japanese articles, and so on.

- **`olw reject --all`** — Reject every pending draft in one step with a shared feedback message. Useful when a bad prompt version or wrong model produced a full batch of unusable drafts.

- **Vault auto-detection** — Commands no longer fail when `--vault` is not passed and no default was saved in `olw setup`. If you're inside a vault directory (or any subdirectory), `olw` finds it automatically by walking up to the nearest `wiki.toml`. The "press Enter to skip" flow in setup now actually makes sense.

### Bug Fixes

- **Review menu shortcuts were invisible in some terminals** — The `olw review` action menu (`[a]pprove`, `[r]eject`, etc.) used Rich markup that silently ate the first letter of each word in terminals with limited style support, showing `pprove eject dit` instead. Prompts now render as plain text (`a=approve, r=reject, e=edit, ...`) and work correctly everywhere.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### Highlights

**v0.3 opens the pipeline to any LLM provider.** Ollama stays the default, but you can now point `olw` at Groq, Together AI, Mistral, LM Studio, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, or any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint — local or cloud. The setup wizard gained a provider selection step, API keys are stored securely in the global config (never in `wiki.toml`), and all pipeline internals use a shared protocol so adding new providers requires no pipeline changes.

### New Features

- **Multi-provider support** — `olw setup` now presents a numbered provider menu covering 9 local runtimes (LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, TGI, SGLang, Llamafile, Lemonade, Ollama) and 11 cloud providers (Groq, Together AI, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, OpenRouter, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, SiliconFlow, Perplexity, xAI / Grok, Azure OpenAI) plus a free-form Custom option. Select by number or name.

- **OpenAI-compatible client** (`openai_compat_client.py`) — thin `httpx` wrapper matching the `OllamaClient` interface. Handles bearer auth, Azure `api-key` header + `?api-version=` query param, JSON mode with auto-downgrade on HTTP 400, and ordered embedding responses.

- **`[provider]` section in `wiki.toml`** — non-Ollama vaults use a `[provider]` block with `name`, `url`, `timeout`, `fast_ctx`, `heavy_ctx` (and `azure_api_version` for Azure). The `[ollama]` section still works unchanged — existing vaults need no migration.

- **API key security** — keys are stored in `~/.config/olw/config.toml` (user-private global config) and resolved at runtime from the provider-specific env var (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`), the generic `OLW_API_KEY` env var, or the global config `api_key` field. They are never written to `wiki.toml`.

- **`LLMClientProtocol`** — structural interface (`typing.Protocol`) that both `OllamaClient` and `OpenAICompatClient` satisfy. All pipeline stages (`ingest`, `compile`, `query`, `orchestrator`, `structured_output`) now depend on the protocol, not the concrete Ollama class.

- **`build_client()` factory** — resolves the correct client from `config.effective_provider`. Pipelines and tests need no awareness of which provider is active.

### Improvements

- `olw doctor` is now provider-aware: shows the active provider name and URL, and gives provider-appropriate hints for missing models
- `olw setup` temp client correctly passes `azure=True` and `supports_embeddings` flags so the health probe uses the right auth header
- Empty URL for `custom` or `azure` provider now exits with a clear error instead of producing cryptic HTTP failures later
- `azure_api_version` flows from `olw setup` → global config → `wiki.toml` (Azure vaults) so each vault can override the API version independently
- `embed_batch` now catches `TimeoutException` and wraps it as `LLMError` (previously only `generate` did)
- `LLMClientProtocol` declares `__enter__`/`__exit__` so type checkers recognise both clients as context managers

### Breaking Changes

None. Ollama remains the default. Existing `wiki.toml` files with `[ollama]` sections work without modification.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Highlights

**v0.2 turns the wiki into a self-improving system.** Drafts can be rejected with feedback, and the next compile automatically addresses it. A new review interface makes approving and rejecting drafts fast. Maintenance tooling keeps the wiki healthy over time.

### New Features

- **Rejection feedback loop** — Reject a draft with a reason (`olw review`), and the next compile injects that feedback into the prompt. Concepts rejected 5+ times are blocked and surfaced in `olw status`.

- **Draft review interface** (`olw review`) — Interactive numbered menu for reviewing drafts. Approve, reject with feedback, edit in `$EDITOR`, diff against published version, or view rejection diff vs previous attempt.

- **Pipeline orchestrator** (`olw run`) — Single command runs the full ingest → compile → lint → approve sequence. Handles selective recompile (only concepts linked to changed notes), transient failure retry, and optional auto-approve.

- **Self-maintenance** (`olw maintain`) — Detects broken wikilinks and auto-creates stub articles for them. Reports orphan articles, near-duplicate concept suggestions, and source quality warnings.

- **Inline draft annotations** — Low-confidence drafts get HTML comment annotations (`<!-- olw-auto: ... -->`) flagging single-source articles, low-quality sources, or uncertain content. Annotations are stripped automatically on approve.

- **Long-note chunked ingest** — Notes larger than the context window are split into chunks, analyzed in parallel (with `ingest_parallel = true`), and merged. Enables processing notes of any length without truncation.

- **Pipeline concurrency lock** — `olw watch` and manual `olw run` no longer race. Advisory file lock (`fcntl.flock`) prevents concurrent pipeline runs from corrupting state.

### Improvements

- Per-concept compile timings in `olw run` output (avg + top-3 slowest)
- `olw setup` shows installed version in header
- Structured output uses fill-in templates instead of raw JSON Schema — reduces model confusion and schema-echo failures
- Ollama requests now set `num_predict` to prevent mid-article JSON truncation
- Schema versioning added — future DB migrations are ordered and transactional

### Bug Fixes

- `httpx.ReadTimeout` during compile now caught and classified as a transient failure (concept is retried, pipeline continues)
- Re-approving a previously published article no longer raises a UNIQUE constraint violation
- `reject_draft` path resolution fixed on macOS
